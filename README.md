# InApplicationNavigationLearning
Learned navigation using NavHost and fragments.  
This makes adding multiple pages to an Android Application very easy and you get a graphical overview of how the different fragments relate to each other.  
The application itself is just two fragments(1 and 2) that you can navigate between.
